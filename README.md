# Bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js

## Customer View
At the start of the program, the storefront is displayed to the user and the user is asked which item they would like to purchase.

When the user is ready, they can respond to the prompt by inputting the item id. The user must select a number if not the entry will not be accepted. When the entry is accepted the user is then asked the quantity of the item they would like to purchase.

Once the item and amount have been logged the program verifies that there is enough stock to meet the customer's demand. If not, the transaction is stopped and the user is prompted with the message stating that there is an insufficient quantity. The user is presented with the storefront to amend their purchase quantity. When the amount of the order can be fulfilled the program calculates and displays the total cost of the user's purchase.

Lastly, the stock updated to reflect the customer's purchase.
